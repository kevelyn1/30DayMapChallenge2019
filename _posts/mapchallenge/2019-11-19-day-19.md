The 19th day - URBAN. I used buildings' data from [Estonian Topographic Database](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Spatial-Data/Estonian-Topographic-Database-p305.html). I selected 5 biggest cities by population according to Estonian Statistics Board. I colored buildings according to their type: residential and industrial.
