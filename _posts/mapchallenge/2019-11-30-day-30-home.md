The 30th and the last day - HOME. For the last 25 years, I can call Tartu my hometown. Therefore I mapped the buildings of Tartu by their footprint elevation above the sea level and color schema blue-black-white because Estonian-language university celebrates its 100th anniversary today.

**Workflow:** I used the building dataset from Estonian Topographic Database and used 'Raster layer zonal statistics' to assign elevation values to the buildings. For visualisation, I needed to create a new color ramp (blue-black-white). To create a new color ramp in QGIS, you need to open Symbology of a layer and click on a color ramp -->Create a new color ramp. Then you need to play around with the colors to achieve the color ramp you wish and save.
