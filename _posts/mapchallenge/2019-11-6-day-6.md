The sixth day - BLUE. Water is blue, so a little experiment to flood Estonia. 

**Workflow:** I used [25m DTM from Estonian Land Board](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/est/Ruumiandmed/Korgusandmed/Laadi-korgusandmed-alla-p614.html) and extracted higher than 10m, 20m, 30m, 40m, 50m and 100m values and visualised them as maps with blue color ramp. I exported the images as maps and created the visualisation by using [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/maker). I must say that Ezgif is super-easy way to make very cool visualisations with no hassle.
