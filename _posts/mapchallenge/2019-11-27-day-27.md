The 27th day - RESOURCES. Tribute to water mills â€“ our forgotten resource. Estonia is full of small water mills that nowadays are mostly not working anymore. There are some rare exceptions like [Hellenurme Water Mill](https://veskimuuseum.ee/) which is still making flour with the power of water. I highly recommend to visit this mill if you already haven't done so :)
