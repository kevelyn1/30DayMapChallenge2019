The third day challenge was POLYGONS. The idea was inspired by one of the discussions with my colleague over geological maps and why one can never see the geological age clearly from them. I tried to visualise the age of the bedrock outcrops in Estonia. Their spatial-temporal arrangement is nicely north-south oriented starting from the older in the north. The dataset is from Estonian Geography CD.
